Program that includes a function that performs binary search.
The prototype of the function is unsigned int BinSearch(unsigned int *pArray, unsigned int uArraySize, unsigned int uValue).
- pArray - pointer to sored array with ascending order of elements
- uArraySize - number of elements in the array
- uValue - searched value (if the value is found, the function should return the index of the value, otherwise 0xFFFF)

Compile:
gcc binarySearch.c funcs.c -o binarySearch

Run:
./binarySearch
